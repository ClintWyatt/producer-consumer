Project 1 README

To compile, type gcc project1.c -lpthread -lrt
To run, type ./a.out

*Note: We limited the number of times the program ran in each thread by putting a counter in the while loops
	  *If you want the program to run for a long time, then comment out the while counter and comment in the while(1)
